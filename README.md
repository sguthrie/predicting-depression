# predicting-depression

Project to downloading the resting-state fMRI data and behavioral data from MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body dataset, preprocess the MRI data through NiPype, building regressors on the MRI and behavioral data to predict depressive behaviors, and predicting depressive behaviors from resting-state fMRI data: either by separating the MPI-Leipzig data into test-training groups or by accessing the Brain Genomics Superstruct project, which has the NEO behavioral data for its subjects.

## Theoretical Motivation

20% of all people are expected to fulfill the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) at some point in their lifetime, and MDD is the second leading contributor to chronic disease burden, yet 50% of patients do not respond or remiss to their first treatment (Benazzi 2006, Gartlehner *et al* 2012, Otte *et al* 2016).

We hope to build a model with a known confidence from over 100 subjects that can predict depression severity given the resting-state fMRI of a subject. We predict the connectivity patterns weighted by the model will implicate regions and tracts affected by and necessary for a depressive phenotype, furthering research into the etiology of depression.

## Research Design

1. Choose a dataset with at least 100 subjects who cover a range of depressive severity.
   - The MPI-Leipzig dataset has ~6 moderately depressed subjects measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All subjects in the lower three-quartiles  are not considered to be depressed. [BDI](https://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/doc/noc/beck_depression_inventory_noc_link.pdf)
   - This pattern is also observed using the HADS-D score to measure depression.
2. Find subjects which have behavioral data of BDI, HADS-D, and NEO-N, and do not fail quality control testing (as run by mriqc).
3. Preprocess the subjects fulfilling the above requirements.
4. Build a connectome for each subject using nilearn.
5. Separate subjects into a large training set and a small test set. (Note, we may choose to use the GSP dataset as our test set.)
6. Build 3 cognitive-based predictive model (CPM) to predict depressive
   phenotypes: BDI, HADS-D, and NEO-N.
   - For each edge in all subjects connectomes, correlate the strength of that edge with the phenotype score. Edges that are most strongly related to behavior in the positive and negative directions are retained for model building. Use cross-validation to ensure reliability of the positive network and the negative network.
   - Build a linear model relating each individualâ€™s positive network strength (i.e., the sum of the connections in their positive network) and negative network strength (i.e., the sum of the connections in their negative network) to their behavioral score.
7. Check the validity of the model against the test set. Predictive power is assessed by correlating predicted and observed behavioral scores across the group.

CPM will be based on the research done by Shen *et al*, 2017.

All computing is currently planned to run using cwl-runner on Arvados, which provides a reproducible computing infrastructure.

## Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis involved in this project will involve correlating the strength of each edge with the phenotype score, model-fitting the CPM, and using cross-validation.

Building a CPM uses a form of linear regression, such as Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation, or robust regression. We plan to use Spearman's rank correlation instead of Pearson's correlation, since depressive severity does not follow a normal distribution in our data. We will use a significance threshold of P=0.01 to choose significantly positive or negative edges in the CPM.

We will fit the CPM model using a least squares polynomial fit (numpy.polyfit)

We shall evaluate the mean squared error and the true prediction correlation to to evaluate the prediction performance of the CPM model.

Ultimately, we hope this project will be used for even more: specifically, expanding to different types of neuroimaging data (sMRI and DTI).

# MRI Data Basics

sguthrie has written a Jupyter Notebook that summarizes her current working knowledge of the basics of MRI data and which data are available in the MPI-Leipzig dataset. This is a work-in-progress.

# Getting to know the MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body Dataset

We provide a Jupyter Notebook allowing users to investigate what range of behavioral data is available from the MPI-Leipzig dataset.
