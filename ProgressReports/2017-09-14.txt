Project Name: Predicting Depression
-----------------------------------

Description
------------

We aim to build a regressor from MRI data that enables prediction
of a depressive phenotype (as measured by NEO, HADS, BDI, etc).
The base plan is to derive a connectome from resting-state fMRI data
from the MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body dataset, then build a
cognitive-based predictive model (CPM) to predict depressive phenotypes.
The accuracy of our model will be tested using cross-validation.
